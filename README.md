# Time-Series-Modelling-
# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA Models in  R

Welcome to the course on Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA Models, where you’ll learn how to leverage ARIMA for predictive modeling with real-world data. This course equips you with the essential knowledge to run ARIMA models in **R**.

## Course Overview

In this project, you’ll explore how to run ARIMA models—a powerful tool for predictive time series modeling—using datasets like:

- **San Diego Electricity Demand**
- **Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina Area Electricity Demand**
- **NY-JFK Airport Temperature Data**

You’ll gain the skills needed to accurately decompose time series data and forecast future trends using these real-world cases.

## What I Learned:

1. **Time Series Decomposition**  
   Understand the components of a time series (trend, seasonality, and residuals) using San Diego electricity demand data.

2. **ARIMA Model Fundamentals**  
   - **Autoregressive (AR) coefficients**
   - **Autocorrelation** and **partial autocorrelation**
   - **Moving Average (MA) coefficients**
   - **Stationarity**: How to achieve and test it in your dataset.
   - **Random Walks and Integration**: Handle non-stationary time series by differencing the data.

3. **Practical Tools & Techniques**  
   - Build ARIMA models in **Excel** for quick forecasting.
   - Use **R** for more sophisticated, statistical-based ARIMA models and validation.
## Case Studies

 Worked on practical case studies using datasets like:
- **San Diego Electricity Demand**: Break down the data into its trend, seasonality, and random components.
- **Raleigh-Durham Electricity Demand**: Apply ARIMA models for long-term electricity demand forecasting.
- **NY-JFK Airport Temperature**: Learn how to predict temperature variations over time.

## Tools Covered:

- **Excel**: Perform basic ARIMA modeling without advanced coding skills.
- **R**: Explore deeper statistical functions and analysis for ARIMA models.
## Outcomes

By the end of the course, I was able to:
- Effectively decompose time series data.
- Build ARIMA models that offer accurate and consistent forecasts.
- Apply new forecasting skills to real-world business data, improving decision-making and forecasting accuracy.
